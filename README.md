# Snake Game using Array Data Structure

Snake Game was the first game played by me in my childhood.I always wanted to create such a amazing game. I wonder how creative were developers at that time as creating this game took too much effort and logical thinking like
1. Designing board and snake
2. Making snake move according to keyboard input
3. Repeating task again and again (Game loop)
4. Boundary constraints (very imp)
5. and various other features
